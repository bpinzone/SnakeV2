DESIGN
    Squares have NO networking. 
    Only manager can change square state. 

    Sync Protocol:
        Player moves (Local delta position check)
        Send cmd to server. (Remote player -> server player -> server manager)
        Server handles logic
            if food
                RPC grow for client
        Server sends RPC updates for square. 
        Server logs
        Client (RPC func) 's manager updates squares with a local update state call. 

    When client connects: server will catch them up with series of RPC's. 
        onLocalPlayerStart- CMD to server to give me stuff.

    On player connect:
        sync num, color, name with server. 
        Once you have your num, get your starting position and direction.
