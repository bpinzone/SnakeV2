Lots of progress, but client player doesn't show.
Watch bounds on 2D arrays
NEXT: Finish logic in server requests. PlayerManager needs work in every regard.
Think about
    singleton?

Squares have NO networking. 
Only manager can change square state. 

Player logistics
    Find out how to sync players and their objects on servers and clients.
        use OnStartClient. public override void OnStartClient(){base.OnStartClient()}
        make sure its not the server.
    Make sure server and all clients have colors set properly.

Sync Protocol:
    Player moves (Local delta position check)
    Send cmd to server.
    Server handles logic
        if food
            RPC grow for client
    Server sends RPC updates for square. 
    Server logs
    Client (RPC func) 's manager updates squares with a local update state call. 

When client connects: server will catch them up with series of RPC's. 
    onLocalPlayerStart- CMD to server to give me stuff.

On player connect:
    sync num, color, name with server. 
    Once you have your num, get your starting position and direction.
    Dont forge to set prev and currTransform
