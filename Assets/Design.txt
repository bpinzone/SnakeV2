Squares have NO networking. 
Only manager can change square state. 

Sync Protocol:
    Player moves (Local delta position check)
    Send cmd to server.
    Server handles logic
        if food
            RPC grow for client
    Server sends RPC updates for square. 
    Server logs
    Client (RPC func) 's manager updates squares with a local update state call. 

When client connects: server will catch them up with series of RPC's. 
    onLocalPlayerStart- CMD to server to give me stuff.

On player connect:
    sync num, color, name with server. 
    Once you have your num, get your starting position and direction.
